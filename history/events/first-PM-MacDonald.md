# Canada's First Prime Minister
## John A. MacDonald
### 1815-1891

The first Prime Minister of Canada was truly a founding father.

Riel fled and the settlement was safely cooped into Canada and in 1870 the province of Manitoba was officially formed. Macdonald offered Riel £1000 to stay away but he did return and in 1874 was elected to the Canadian Parliament. Macdonald considered him a clever fellow and Riel even managed an appearance in Ottawa at the House of Commons. Macdonald’s next step was to bring British Columbia into Confederation. BC had been inundated with American prospectors during the Barkerville gold rush in the 1850’s and quick action by Governor Douglas brought the colonies of Vancouver Island and the mainland together as the British Colony of British Columbia in 1866. BC was cut off from the rest of Canada by the mountains and a large
